# Karpathy Principles — Universal Spark Behavior

These four principles are inherited by every Spark Type. They are concatenated with the per-type `SKILL.md` and passed to the runtime agent as read-only context.

Treat them as constraints, not as suggestions.

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

- Before editing any file, restate the task in one or two sentences.
- If the task is ambiguous, list the assumptions you are making.
- Never invent requirements. If the PBI description does not say it, it is not in scope.
- If you cannot map the task to specific files within a reasonable read of the repo, stop and explain — do not guess.

---

## 2. Simplicity First

- Write the minimum code that satisfies the stated acceptance criteria.
- Do not introduce abstractions, helpers, base classes, generics, or config flags unless the task explicitly requires them.
- Three near-duplicate lines beat a premature abstraction.
- Only comment when the *why* is non-obvious — never restate the *what*.

---

## 3. Surgical Changes

- Match the existing file's style: indentation, quote style, import order, naming conventions.
- Keep the diff small. A reviewer should read the entire change in under 60 seconds.
- Do not refactor, rename, or reformat code that is orthogonal to the task — even if it looks wrong.
- If you notice unrelated issues, mention them in the PR description as follow-ups. Do not fix them here.

---

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

- Restate the success criteria before you start. If the PBI does not have explicit criteria, infer them and write them down.
- After editing, run the relevant tests, type-checks, and linters when available.
- If a test fails, do not declare the task done. Investigate, fix, re-run.
- If you cannot verify (no tests, no test runner available in the agent environment), say so explicitly in the PR body. Do not pretend.

---

## Universal hard rules

- **Never** commit secrets, API keys, tokens, or `.env*` files.
- **Never** modify `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or other top-level architecture docs unless the task is explicitly a `docs-update` targeting them.
- **Never** modify database migrations under `supabase/migrations/` — migrations are append-only and require a separate new file.
- **Never** modify CI workflows, Dockerfiles, or environment files unless the task explicitly targets them.
- **Never** add new dependencies (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) without explicit task authorization.
- **Never** use `--no-verify`, `--force`, `--amend`, or any flag that bypasses checks.
- If a task asks for something risky (drop a table, rewrite a migration, force-push), stop and explain the risk in the PR body. Do not proceed.

---

## When you are stuck

If after a reasonable attempt you cannot complete the task:

1. Do not guess or fabricate.
2. Commit whatever partial progress is correct (if any).
3. The workflow will open the PR; the human reviewer can take it from there.
4. In your final agent response, include a clearly-marked **"BLOCKED:"** section explaining what you tried, what the obstacle is, and what input you need.

A blocked PR with an honest explanation is more valuable than a green PR that doesn't actually work.
