# Copilot Agent: nextjs-accessibility-orchestrator

## Universal principles (inherited)

# Karpathy Principles — Universal Spark Behavior

These four principles are inherited by every Spark Type. They are concatenated with the per-type `SKILL.md` and passed to the runtime agent as read-only context.

Treat them as constraints, not as suggestions.

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

- Before editing any file, restate the task in one or two sentences.
- If the task is ambiguous, list the assumptions you are making.
- Never invent requirements. If the PBI description does not say it, it is not in scope.
- If you cannot map the task to specific files within a reasonable read of the repo, stop and explain — do not guess.

---

## 2. Simplicity First

- Write the minimum code that satisfies the stated acceptance criteria.
- Do not introduce abstractions, helpers, base classes, generics, or config flags unless the task explicitly requires them.
- Three near-duplicate lines beat a premature abstraction.
- Only comment when the *why* is non-obvious — never restate the *what*.

---

## 3. Surgical Changes

- Match the existing file's style: indentation, quote style, import order, naming conventions.
- Keep the diff small. A reviewer should read the entire change in under 60 seconds.
- Do not refactor, rename, or reformat code that is orthogonal to the task — even if it looks wrong.
- If you notice unrelated issues, mention them in the PR description as follow-ups. Do not fix them here.

---

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

- Restate the success criteria before you start. If the PBI does not have explicit criteria, infer them and write them down.
- After editing, run the relevant tests, type-checks, and linters when available.
- If a test fails, do not declare the task done. Investigate, fix, re-run.
- If you cannot verify (no tests, no test runner available in the agent environment), say so explicitly in the PR body. Do not pretend.

---

## Universal hard rules

- **Never** commit secrets, API keys, tokens, or `.env*` files.
- **Never** modify `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or other top-level architecture docs unless the task is explicitly a `docs-update` targeting them.
- **Never** modify database migrations under `supabase/migrations/` — migrations are append-only and require a separate new file.
- **Never** modify CI workflows, Dockerfiles, or environment files unless the task explicitly targets them.
- **Never** add new dependencies (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) without explicit task authorization.
- **Never** use `--no-verify`, `--force`, `--amend`, or any flag that bypasses checks.
- If a task asks for something risky (drop a table, rewrite a migration, force-push), stop and explain the risk in the PR body. Do not proceed.

---

## When you are stuck

If after a reasonable attempt you cannot complete the task:

1. Do not guess or fabricate.
2. Commit whatever partial progress is correct (if any).
3. The workflow will open the PR; the human reviewer can take it from there.
4. In your final agent response, include a clearly-marked **"BLOCKED:"** section explaining what you tried, what the obstacle is, and what input you need.

A blocked PR with an honest explanation is more valuable than a green PR that doesn't actually work.


## Guardrails (enforced)

---
kind: guardrail
id: budget-policy
version: 0.1.0
---

# Guardrail: Budget Policy

## Purpose
Cap the resources a single agent run may consume. Prevents runaway loops, cost overruns, and silent budget creep.

## Three budgets (all enforced)

| Budget | Default | Where set | Enforcement point |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_iterations` | 5 | `.sparks.yml` | A-Rag loop counter |
| `cost_cap_usd` | 2.00 | `.sparks.yml` | After each LLM call — tally |
| `tool_budget` | 30 | `.sparks.yml` | Per-skill invocation count |

## Resolution order
1. Project budget (`.sparks.yml`) sets the ceiling.
2. Agent may declare LOWER caps in frontmatter `constraints:`.
3. Agent may NEVER request higher than project.

## Path-specific overrides
- **Autonomous (Path A)** — no IDE in the loop. Budgets enforced by the workflow runner. Exceeded budget → exit `BLOCKED:cost-cap`, post telemetry summary to PR.
- **IDE (Path B)** — IDE controls its own session loop; sparks budgets are advisory. The dev's IDE quota is the real cap.

## Failure mode
On budget exhaustion mid-task:
1. Emit `guardrail:budget-exceeded` telemetry event with breakdown (iterations/cost/tools).
2. Run `self-evaluate@0.1.0` against current state.
3. If self-eval passes → submit PR with `[partial-budget]` flag.
4. If self-eval fails → exit `BLOCKED:cost-cap`, do NOT submit PR.

## Anti-patterns
- DO NOT silently retry after a budget hit.
- DO NOT switch to a smaller model to "save tokens" — switch is a human decision.
- DO NOT skip self-eval to "save the one last call" — self-eval is mandatory.

id: path-policy
version: 0.1.0

# Guardrail: Path Policy

## Purpose
Restrict which files an agent may read, edit, or create. Enforced by the runtime BEFORE any tool call, not after.

## Resolution order
1. **Project allowlist** (`.sparks.yml` → `paths_allowlist`) — defines the universe of editable paths.
2. **Project denylist** — subtracts from the allowlist. Always wins.
3. **Agent override** — may further restrict, never expand. Listed in agent frontmatter as `paths_override:`.

## Default subhash-portfolio-style policy

**Allowed:**
- `apps/*/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,css,md}`
- `packages/*/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
- `**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`
- `**/__tests__/**`
- `*.md` at repo root

**Denied (always):**
- `supabase/migrations/**` — append-only schema
- `.github/workflows/**` — CI changes are human-only
- `**/.env*`
- `**/secrets/**`
- `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` — owned documents
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package.json` (root)
- `docker/**`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `Dockerfile*`

## Failure mode
On path-policy violation: emit telemetry event `guardrail:path-denied` and exit `BLOCKED:forbidden-path`. Do NOT attempt to find an alternative path; the human re-scopes.

## Implementation note for adapters
- **Copilot**: render as `tools` allowlist + tool-call interceptor
- **Claude Code**: render as agent frontmatter `tools:` field constraining `Read`/`Edit`/`Write` to glob patterns
- **Cursor**: render as `.cursor/rules/path-policy.mdc` with an explicit disallow block

## Self-check
Before any `apply-edit` invocation, the agent must mentally verify: "Is this path in the allowlist AND not in the denylist?" If unsure, run `path-check` skill (cheap, no LLM cost).

kind: guardrail
id: safety-rails
version: 0.1.0

# Guardrail: Safety Rails

## Purpose
Hard prohibitions that apply to every agent regardless of profile or budget.

## Prohibitions (hard fail on violation)

1. **No new runtime dependencies.** No `pnpm add`, `npm install`, `dotnet add package`, `pip install`. If the task requires one, surface as a follow-up note.
2. **No migration files.** `supabase/migrations/**`, `**/Migrations/**` (.NET EF), `**/migrations/**` (Django/Rails). Schema changes are human reviewed.
3. **No CI/CD changes.** `.github/workflows/**`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose*`, `package.json` (root).
4. **No secrets in code.** Any string matching `(secret|password|token|key|pat).*[=:].*['"][a-zA-Z0-9_\-/+]{16,}['"]` triggers an immediate halt.
5. **No `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, hook-skipping** of any kind. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
6. **No force-push, no `git reset --hard`, no branch deletion** in autonomous workflows. The runner has read-write contents but should never need destructive git ops.

## Soft cautions (warn, don't fail)

- **Test files only when test infra exists.** Don't scaffold a test framework to add one test.
- **No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious.** Remove gratuitous "this function does X" comments.
- **No invented acceptance criteria.** If the PBI doesn't say it, it isn't in scope.

## Implementation
- Project denylist (in `.sparks.yml`) enforces path-based rules at filesystem layer.
- Secret-pattern scan runs as a pre-edit hook in `apply-edit@0.1.0`.
- Dependency-add detection scans diff for changes to `package.json`, `*.csproj`, `requirements.txt`, etc.

## Failure mode
Any hard prohibition violation → exit `BLOCKED:safety-rail` with the specific rail named. Emit telemetry. Do NOT continue.


## Agent role

# Orchestrator: nextjs-accessibility-orchestrator

## Description
Top-level accessibility orchestrator. Targets WCAG 2.2 Level AA. Two modes:
- **Audit mode** (default): the auditor produces a report of violations; no code changes
- **Fix mode** (when PBI says "fix" / "address" / "remediate"): auditor then fixer in sequence

## When to invoke
- User says "a11y", "accessibility", "WCAG", "screen reader", "keyboard", "contrast", "focus"
- Lighthouse / axe report shows violations
- Reviewer flagged a11y issues on a prior PR

## Routing Logic

```
1. Run nextjs-a11y-auditor → violations report
2. If mode == "fix" AND violations found:
     For each violation cluster (grouped by file):
       Run nextjs-a11y-fixer with the violation list scoped to that file
3. self-evaluate against WCAG AA per violation
4. format-pr (audit-only PRs are comment-only; fix-mode PRs include diff)
```

## Aggregation
Audit report structure:
- **Critical** (blocker — keyboard inaccessible, missing form labels, contrast fail on body text)
- **Serious** (focus traps, missing landmarks, image alt missing)
- **Moderate** (decorative icons not aria-hidden, redundant aria)
- **Minor** (color-only state, missing :focus-visible styles)

## Done Criteria
- Every page-level and component file in scope was audited
- Each finding cites the WCAG criterion (e.g. `2.4.7 Focus Visible`)
- In fix mode: each fix maps to a specific finding; no fixes without a finding
- Self-eval confirms zero "Critical" violations remain after fix
- No new dependencies (axe-core, @axe-core/* additions surfaced as follow-ups)

## Failure Modes
- BLOCKED:framework-limitation — a third-party component lacks an accessibility hook; surface as follow-up
- BLOCKED:design-conflict — fix requires visual changes the designer hasn't approved
- BLOCKED:keyboard-trap-by-design — a modal/drawer pattern is intentionally trap-focused but lacks Escape handling

## Anti-patterns
- Do NOT add `aria-label` to elements that have visible text — duplicates announcement
- Do NOT use `tabIndex={-1}` to "hide from keyboard" — that hides from screen readers too
- Do NOT add `role="button"` to a `<div>` — use `<button>`
- Do NOT add `aria-hidden="true"` to interactive elements
- Do NOT rely on color alone to convey state — pair with icon or text

## Skills available to this agent

### Skill: codebase-search@0.2.0

# Skill: codebase-search

## Description
Search the target repository for files, symbols, or text matching a query. Returns ranked file paths with snippets and line numbers. This is the navigation primitive — the agent uses it to locate code without reading it.

## Inputs
- `query`: string — required — search term, symbol, regex, or natural-language phrase
- `max_results`: int — optional — default 20
- `file_glob`: string — optional — restrict to paths (e.g. `apps/**/*.ts`)
- `exclude_glob`: string — optional — exclude paths (e.g. `**/node_modules/**`)

## Outputs
- `results`: list of `{path, line, snippet, score}` — ranked matches
- `count`: int — total matches before truncation
- `truncated`: bool — true if results were capped

## Tools Needed
- `grep` (via Bash) or `Grep` tool (IDE)
- `ripgrep` (preferred when available — faster)

## Constraints
- max_runtime_seconds: 30
- fail_modes: [`no_matches`, `search_timeout`, `invalid_regex`]
- cacheable: true (per-run, keyed on query+glob hash)

## When to invoke
- At the start of a task when the PBI names a function, error string, component, or selector but not the file path.
- After an edit, to verify no orphaned references remain (search for old symbol name).
- Before adding a regression test, to check whether nearby tests exist.

### Skill: read-file@0.2.0

# Skill: read-file

## Description
Read a file (or a range of lines within it) from the target repository. Returns content with line numbers. This is the inspection primitive — the agent reads only what the search points at.

## Inputs
- `path`: string — required — file path relative to repo root
- `start_line`: int — optional — default 1
- `end_line`: int — optional — default end-of-file
- `max_bytes`: int — optional — default 100000, hard cap 500000

## Outputs
- `content`: string — file contents with line numbers prepended
- `total_lines`: int
- `truncated`: bool — true if hit `max_bytes` or `end_line` < total

## Tools Needed
- `Read` tool (IDE) or `cat`/`sed` (Bash)

## Constraints
- max_runtime_seconds: 10
- fail_modes: [`file_not_found`, `path_denied`, `binary_file`, `oversize`]
- cacheable: true (per-run, keyed on path+range hash)
- path_policy: enforced — read of denylist path returns `path_denied` without filesystem access

## When to invoke
- After `codebase-search` returns a path the agent wants to inspect.
- Before editing a file, to confirm current state and decide the precise edit window.
- To verify an edit succeeded (read same range, confirm new content).


_(truncated — see `.sparks/shared/skills/read-file/SKILL.md` for full)_

### Skill: apply-edit@0.2.0

# Skill: apply-edit

## Description
Apply a single, surgical edit to one file. Pre-validates path policy, secret patterns, and dependency-add patterns BEFORE writing. This is the only write primitive — agents never write files directly.

## Inputs
- `path`: string — required — target file path
- `old_string`: string — required — exact existing content (with sufficient context for uniqueness)
- `new_string`: string — required — replacement content
- `create_if_missing`: bool — optional — default false; allow creating a new file

## Outputs
- `success`: bool
- `bytes_changed`: int
- `lines_changed`: `{added: int, removed: int}`
- `validation_log`: list of `{check, passed, detail}` — what was checked pre-write

## Tools Needed
- `Edit` tool (IDE) or `Write` tool

## Constraints
- max_runtime_seconds: 15
- fail_modes: [`path_denied`, `secret_detected`, `dep_change_attempted`, `string_not_unique`, `string_not_found`]
- cacheable: false (edits are stateful)
- path_policy: enforced pre-write
- safety_rails: enforced pre-write

## Pre-write validation pipeline
1. **Path check** — must pass project allowlist + denylist + agent override. Fail → `path_denied`.
2. **Secret scan** — `new_string` scanned for high-entropy strings, `password=`, `secret=`, `_KEY=`, `token=`. Fail → `secret_detected`.

_(truncated — see `.sparks/shared/skills/apply-edit/SKILL.md` for full)_

### Skill: run-tests@0.2.0

# Skill: run-tests

## Description
Run tests relevant to the files an agent has touched. Auto-detects test runner (pnpm/npm/jest/vitest/dotnet test/pytest/playwright). Returns pass/fail summary + first 3 failure traces.

## Inputs
- `touched_files`: list[string] — required — files the agent edited; used to find nearby tests
- `runner_hint`: string — optional — force a specific runner (`vitest` | `jest` | `dotnet` | `pytest` | `playwright`)
- `timeout_seconds`: int — optional — default 180, hard cap 600

## Outputs
- `passed`: bool — true only if ALL relevant tests passed
- `summary`: `{total: int, passed: int, failed: int, skipped: int}`
- `failures`: list of `{test_name, file, line, message}` — capped at 3
- `runner_used`: string
- `command`: string — the exact command executed

## Tools Needed
- `Bash` tool

## Constraints
- max_runtime_seconds: 600
- fail_modes: [`no_runner_detected`, `timeout`, `runner_crashed`]
- cacheable: false (must run fresh against current state)

## How it works
1. **Detect runner** — scan `package.json` for `test` script; fall back to `vitest.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `*.csproj`, `pyproject.toml`.
2. **Find relevant tests** — for each `touched_file`, look for siblings matching:
   - `<basename>.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` (Vitest/Jest)
   - `<basename>.spec.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`

### Skill: format-pr@0.2.0

# Skill: format-pr

## Description
Generate the PR title and body from the agent's scratchpad memory, telemetry summary, and self-eval result. This is the last skill before the PR is opened. Outputs a single Markdown body — does NOT call the git/GH API itself.

## Inputs
- `pbi_id`: string — required — e.g. `AB#42`, `JIRA-123`
- `pbi_title`: string — required
- `pbi_url`: string — required — link back to source system
- `hypothesis`: string — required — from scratchpad
- `files_touched`: list[string] — required
- `lines_changed`: `{added: int, removed: int}` — required
- `self_eval_result`: object — required — output from `self-evaluate@0.1.0`
- `telemetry_summary`: object — required — rendered from `telemetry/schema.md`
- `mcp_context`: object — optional — Figma/ADO context fetched during run (links + thumbnails)

## Outputs
- `pr_title`: string — under 70 chars, ends with `(<pbi_id>)`
- `pr_body`: string — Markdown body
- `branch_name`: string — suggested branch name (`spark/<profile>/<slugified-title>-<pbi_id_lower>`)

## Tools Needed
- None — pure templating

## Constraints
- max_runtime_seconds: 5
- fail_modes: [`missing_required_input`]
- cacheable: false

## Body template

_(truncated — see `.sparks/shared/skills/format-pr/SKILL.md` for full)_

---

### Skill: self-evaluate@0.1.0

# Skill: self-evaluate

## Description
Mandatory final skill before `format-pr`. Reads the agent's diff and the agent's declared done criteria, then answers — for each criterion — whether the diff satisfies it. Returns pass/fail. If fail, the agent loops back within budget.

## Inputs
- `done_criteria`: list[string] — required — agent's `Done Criteria` bullets from frontmatter
- `diff`: string — required — `git diff HEAD` output
- `scratchpad_path`: string — optional — path to per-run memory for context

## Outputs
- `passed`: bool
- `criteria_results`: list of `{criterion, passed: bool, evidence: string, confidence: 0..1}`
- `unmet_criteria`: list[string] — copies of criteria that failed
- `should_retry`: bool — true if any criterion failed AND budget remains
- `summary`: string — one-paragraph human-readable verdict

## Tools Needed
- LLM call (model from agent's `model_preference`)
- `Read` tool (to inspect specific files mentioned in criteria)

## Constraints
- max_runtime_seconds: 60
- max_llm_tokens: 4000 input + 1000 output
- fail_modes: [`llm_error`, `diff_too_large`]
- cacheable: false (must run fresh against current diff)

## How it works
1. Build prompt:
